# Upload Images to GitHub's CDN

This is especially useful for when you want to attach images or gifs to readme files but don't want to upload them to a different site.


Enter any github project and start to create a new issue by clicking the **New Issue** button. Drag-and-drop an image on to the description field.

Once GitHub is done uploading the image they will automagically add the URL to the description field.

#### Ex
```text
![marty-mcfly](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/499192/8718466/e58c679c-2ba4-11e5-8e3c-3f9955b810f7.jpg)
```

Now you can copy the URL and use it in README files, issues or pull requests how ever you like.
